<h1>Makebook:  For Printing, Folding, and Binding</h1>

<p><span class="fl">M</span>akebook is a script for
<em>impressing</em> pdf pages; in other words, for taking a
normal pdf and rearranging them to place multiple pages on
the same target sheet, so that they can be printed, folded,
and bound.  Although it is a simple script (less than seven
hundred lines at last count), it's still extremely
configurable and quite powerful for its task.</p>

<p>Makebook is written entirely in POSIX-compatible shell,
usually called with /bin/sh.  As such, it's about as
portable as a shell script can be.  It does have a few <a
href="depends.html">dependencies</a>, to take advantage of
several very powerful tools that already exist for
manipulating pdfs.  It also has very complete <a
href="docs.html">documentation</a>, to help you learn how to
use its many configuration options.</p>

<p>Finally, though it seems unlikely that makebook would
ever be a vector for an attack, it goes out of its way to
make that impossible.  Temporary files are randomly named in
order to prevent race conditions, new files are set with
restrictive permissions, and so forth.  Makebook is a
program that you can trust.</p>
