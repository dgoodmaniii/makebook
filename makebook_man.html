<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>makebook</b>
A utility for taking a normal pdf and impressing multiple
pages onto single pages for printing, folding, and binding
as a booklet or book. Supports folio, quarto, sexto, octavo,
and duodecimo signatures; scaling of source pages; explicit
or implicit determination of target page dimensions; and
more options. Non-destructive; the original file is not
effected.</p>

<p>What we commonly call the &quot;page&quot; of a book,

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>signature</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Loosely used by makebook to
mean a single sheet of paper, folded up to produce a given
number of leaves and pages. Traditionally a signature was
actually simply the mark put on a sheet to tell the binder
in what order the sheets, once folded, should be bound,
usually just an uppercase Roman letter or some similar mark;
however, I&rsquo;ve chosen to use &quot;signature&quot; to
mean a single sheet, which may be equivalent to
&quot;section&quot; (see below) or may not be. Sections may
contain multiple signatures, but a signature is always
unitary. Signatures can be of many different types,
traditionally named by the number of leaves they produce.
E.g., a folio signature produces two leaves; a quarto
produces four; an octavo eight; and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>section</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A self-contained part of a
book, properly folded and ready for binding. Sections may
consist of one or more signatures, and a book may be made up
of one or more sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t</b> <i>signature
type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">What type of signature you
want. You can use either the traditional term or the
traditional abbreviation for the accepted types of
signature: <b><br>
folio, 2o</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">folded once, for four pages per
sheet</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>quarto, 4to</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">folded twice, for eigth pages
per sheet</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>sexto, 6to</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">folded once, then cut, the new
piece folded again; six pages per side of sheet</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>octavo, 8vo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">folded three times, for sixteen
pages per sheet</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>duodecimo, 12mo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">folded twice times, then cut,
the new piece folded again; twelve pages per side of
sheet</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The user may
give either the long or the short versions of these
signatures types, separated above by commas, with no change
in <b>makebook</b>&rsquo;s effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Defaults to
&quot;folio&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;n</b> <i>signatures
per section</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Provides the number of
signatures of the given type which will be assembled into
each section. Defaults to one. Note that this option only
works for folio and quarto signatures; though
<b>makebook</b> will not complain if you try it with others,
your results will (probably) be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;H</b> <i>height of
target page</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The height of the page onto
which <b>makebook</b> will impress the pages of the original
document. If omitted, <b>makebook</b> will simply multiply
the dimensions of the original page according to the type of
signature and use that, so as not to require any scaling of
the source pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;w</b> <i>width of
target page</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The width of the page onto
which <b>makebook</b> will impress the pages of the original
document. If omitted, <b>makebook</b> will simply multiply
the dimensions of the original page according to the type of
signature and use that, so as not to require any scaling of
the source pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d</b> <i>horiz.
delta</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alters the horizontal distance
between impressed sheets on the target page. Defaults to
0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b> <i>vert.
delta</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Alters the vertical distance
between impressed sheets on the target page. Defaults to
0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m</b> <i>horiz.
offset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Requires <b>makebook</b> to
place the upper left corner of each impressed page offset
horizontally by this amount. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;M</b> <i>vert.
offset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Requires <b>makebook</b> to
place the upper left corner of each impressed page offset
vertically by this amount. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>
<i>scale</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If you intend to scale the
page, enter the scaling factor here. &quot;1&quot; will not
scale at all; less than 1 will reduce the page&rsquo;s size,
greater than 1 will increase it. Use this with care; scaling
nearly always degrades the quality of the result, no matter
how careful you were with your vector graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i</b> <i>input
file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the name of the input
file; that is, the file that <b>makebook</b> will be
imposing onto a new document. If not provided,
<b>makebook</b> will simply use standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o</b> <i>output
file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the name of the
output file which <b>makebook</b> should use for the result
of its operations. If omitted, <b>makebook</b> will prepend
the string &quot;sigs_&quot; to the beginning of the input
file name and use that. To use standard output, include this
option, but give &quot;stdout&quot; for the filename.</p>

<h2>DIMENSIONS
<a name="DIMENSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
Dimensions <br>
makebook</b>, as will be seen below, permits the explicit
statement of some dimensions. Absent such statement,
however, default values will be assigned. Furthermore, the
size of the input page cannot be set explicitly; it is
always determined automatically by the script. This section
explains a bit how these dimensions are determined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>THE SOURCE
PAGE:</b> The dimensions of the source page are determined
very simply, by running &quot;pdfinfo&quot; through an awk
filter and taking that at face value. This has worked well
for the author&rsquo;s purposes. These dimensions cannot be
set explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>THE TARGET
PAGE:</b> The dimensions of the target page can be specified
explicitly at the command line, with &quot;-H&quot; and
&quot;-w&quot;. If they are not, however, <b>makebook</b>
does its best to give them sensible values. However, I did
not want makebook to assume a given paper size (and thus
begin a letterpaper vs. A4 firestorm) or to assume a desired
scaling (and thus have a default which probably ruins page
quality), so it does so very simply.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>makebook</b>
simply multiplies the source page dimensions by appropriate
values to ensure that the target page will be exactly the
correct size to hold the requested type of signature
assuming no scaling of the source page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
if a pdf source document is on halfletter paper (that is,
8.5in x 5.5in), and folio signatures are requested, the
resulting document will be 8.5in x 11in (normal letter
paper). If a pdf is on letter paper, and folio signatures
are requested, the resulting document will be 11in x 17in
(normal ledger paper). If a document is set on 5.5in x
4.25in paper (a quarter of a normal letter page), and quarto
signatures are requested, the resulting document will be
8.5in x 11in (normal letter paper). The same applies, of
course, to metric paper sizes, and even to abnormal page
sizes. makebook was largely tested, for example, using a
source document set on 4.25in x 6in paper, and by default
produced an 8.5in x 12in signature sheet. (Better results
were obtained by explicitly requesting 8.5in x 14in paper,
or normal legal paper, with a vertical delta, or -D, of
1in.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
both deltas (-d and -D) and offsets (-m and -M) are set at
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
scaling is also set at 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Explicit
Dimensions <br>
makebook</b> assumes that all dimensions are in &quot;big
points&quot; (bp); that is, Postscript points, of which
there are 72 in an inch. This is easiest because pdf uses
Postscript points internally, and pdfinfo consequently gives
Postscript points as dimensions when they are requested. Any
dimensions given without units will therefore be assumed to
be big points.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>makebook</b>
will also accept other units, however; below are the units
<b>makebook</b> understands. In parentheses after those
units are the abbreviations which <b>makebook</b> knows;
unless you specify the units with these abbreviations,
<b>makebook</b> won&rsquo;t understand you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>inches (in) <br>
centimeters (cm) <br>
points (pt) <br>
picas (pc) <br>
big points (bp)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that &quot;pt&quot; is the traditional printers&rsquo;
point, not the Postscript &quot;big point&quot;; traditional
printers&rsquo; points are slightly smaller than big points,
there being 72.27 of them per inch. Picas here is twelve
(12) printers&rsquo; points, not twelve big points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To input these
other units, simply attach their abbreviations directly to
their numbers; e.g., &quot;8.5in&quot;. makebook will
recognize such measurements and convert them into bp for use
internally.</p>

<h2>FILLING UP SECTIONS
<a name="FILLING UP SECTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, the
number of pages in the source document doesn&rsquo;t match
up with the number of pages necessary to set all the pages
into sections each containing an equal number of pages.
However, it is necessary (at least in traditional binding)
to have sections of equal numbers of leaves. A book so
arranged is called &quot;perfect&quot;; a book not so
arranged is called &quot;imperfect.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To accomplish
this, blank pages are added to the front and back of the
book when necessary. (That is, to the first and last
sections.) As far as possible, equal numbers of blank pages
are added both to the front and back of the book; if uneven
numbers of blank pages are required, one additional blank
page is added to the back. If, however, that would result in
an uneven number of blanks in the front, one additional
blank page is added to the back and one fewer to the front.
This ensures that odd-numbered folios will always correctly
appear on recto pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One can,
however, force <b>makebook</b> to favor the front rather
than the back when unequal numbers of blanks are required to
make the book perfect. This is specified with the
&quot;<b>&minus;f</b>&quot; option. With this option
specified, <b>makebook</b> follows precisely the same
procedure in determining the number of blanks; when
it&rsquo;s done, however, it simply switches the number
which goes in the front with that which goes in the back.
Note that this sometimes results in the same number of
blanks at the front and the back both with and without the
&quot;-f&quot; flag set; for example, if the number of
blanks is &quot;2&quot; at the front and &quot;3&quot; at
the back. As the program is currently written, there is no
way to avoid this.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>To set a
short eight-page document for quarto printing as a
booklet.</b> Run the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">makebook -v -t
quarto -i source.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>To set a
brochure of 16 pages or less for printing as a booklet.</b>
Run the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">makebook -v -t
octavo -i source.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both of these
examples assume that your pages are properly sized to fit on
your target sheet; e.g., that you have one-quarter
letterpaper size pages to be set in quarto on a standard
U.S. letterpaper sheet. If not, you may have to get more
creative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>For imposing
more-or-less standard LaTeX-produced pages in folio on U.S.
letter-paper</b>, the following has proved to be
<i>mostly</i> serviceable:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">makebook -i
file.pdf -H 8.5in -w 11in -t 2o -v -d &quot;-1.1in&quot; -s
0.8333 -n 2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This provides
minimal scaling of the page to maintain maximum quality,
while still adjusting things as necessary to fit. It&rsquo;s
likely that you&rsquo;ll need to do some tweaking,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>For imposing
pages originally designed for A4 paper in folio on A4</b>,
the following is at least worth trying:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">makebook -v -i
file.pdf -n 2 -t 2o -w 29.7cm -H 21cm -s 0.8</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Again,
it&rsquo;s quite likely that you&rsquo;ll need to do some
tweaking of these measurements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
always <i>much</i> easier to impose pages in their original
size, and it mostly looks a lot better, too. For example,
the last example, when imposing A5 pages onto A4 paper in
folio, looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">makebook -v -i
file.pdf -n2 -t 2o</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
easier to look at, easier to write, and produces better
results. If you intend to print and bind yourself,
<i>please</i> consider your final output size when you
design your book; it&rsquo;ll make it easier for you and
nicer for your readers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is often
desirable to set a document which one plans to impose on a
given size paper such that a larger size paper will be
appropriate. The author, for example, had good luck imposing
a 6in x 4.25in document into quarto signatures on legal size
paper (8.5in x 14in) with the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">makebook -v -i
file.pdf -H 14in -w 8.5in -D 1in -t 4to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Initially, I
had intended to set the book for quarto signatures on letter
paper, but the fit was too tight; using legal paper instead
allowed me to increase the page height from 5.5in to 6in and
still have plenty of room for trimming and binding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is often
helpful, when determining appropriate settings, to cut out a
few signatures&rsquo; worth of pages from the true document
and to run the tests on that. makebook takes some time to
run, and using fewer signatures can save a great deal of
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Happy
binding!</p>

<h2>CAUTIONS
<a name="CAUTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
you&rsquo;re printing these documents on a duplex printer,
keep in mind that the side on which you flip can have an
effect on whether the pages line up correctly. For a quarto
signature, for example, if your duplex printer gives you the
option, tell it to flip on the &quot;long&quot; edge; but
for an octavo, tell it to flip on the &quot;short&quot;
edge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The more
complex signatures (especially sexto, octavo, and duodecimo)
may require some practice to fold correctly. Remember that
you will have to cut some of the creases to make the book
open correctly. It&rsquo;s best to print out a signature or
two separately and practice folding before printing the
entire book.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple-signature
sections in signatures other than folio and quarto do not
work properly. They should.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is at
present no method to specify how many blank pages one would
like at the front and how many at the back, because
it&rsquo;s not clear to me why anyone would want to. But it
would be good to have the option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is at
present no method to deliberately make the book imperfect;
for example, to round off a quarto book with a folio section
on smaller paper. I&rsquo;m not sure that there is any
really good reason to do this anyway, but again, it would be
good to have the option.</p>
