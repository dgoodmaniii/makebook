<h1>Makebook:  Dependencies</h1>

<p><span class="fl">M</span>akebook is a shell script, and
as such, it depends on a few other programs to do its work.
This is an advantage for makebook; it doesn't have to
duplicate functions that have already been implemented
elsewhere.  If you do not have these dependencies installed,
makebook will warn you about it and fail.</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/od-invocation.html">od</a>:
This is one of the GNU coreutils, so it's pretty likely that
you already have it; if not, it's easily installed.
Makebook uses od to produce its random file names.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ctan.org">pdflatex</a>:  Obviously;
pdflatex does much of the grunt work behind the scenes in
makebook.  TeXLive is the best distribution.</li>
<li><a
href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html">pdfinfo</a>:
Part of the <a
href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/index.html">xpdf</a>
bundle.  Makebook uses this to determine the dimensions of
the source pages.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/">pdftk</a>:
The pdf toolkit; makebook uses this to tear apart the source
pdf and feed it to pdflatex.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have these installed, you're ready to go.</p>
